# LeagueDeck

LeagueDeck is a plugin for the Stream Deck that provides tools to help you keep track of your game and enables you to predict your enemies more accurately.

## Installation

To install this plugin, head over to [releases](https://github.com/TimeBlaster/LeagueDeck/releases) and download the latest version.\
After the download finished just open the file and LeagueDeck should show up in your Stream Deck App.

## Usage

#### Note: For best results a Stream Deck with at least 15 keys is recommended.

### Summoner Spell Timer

Drag the action into your Stream Deck and select the summoner and spell you want to be displayed.\
Once the game starts the summoner spells from the enemy team are loaded including the champion's icon.\
You can enable automatic chat messages that display the accurate in game time when the spell will be back up.\

**!!! Make sure you press Escape after every key press. !!!**\
Your keyboard is captured for the chat message and I haven't managed to fix that yet.

### Ultimate Cooldowns

Not implemented yet but will follow soon.
