# LeagueDeck

LeagueDeck is a plugin for the Stream Deck that provides tools to help you keep track of your game and enables you to predict your enemies more accurately.

## Version 2.0 released!
- Sending a chat message no longer requires you to press 'Escape'
- Now downloads all required assets (Champion and Spell Data/Images) when a new version comes out. Download time: ~10 minutes.
- Added support for basic abilities and ultimates.
- You can now set an offset to lower the starting cooldown. Useful when you don't press the key immediately.
- No longer requires you to install a root certificate from Riot Games to use the API.

## Installation

To install this plugin, head over to [releases](https://github.com/TimeBlaster/LeagueDeck/releases) and download the latest version.\
After the download finished just open the file and LeagueDeck should show up in your Stream Deck App.

## Usage

#### Note: For best results a Stream Deck with at least 15 keys is recommended.

### Spell Timer

Drag the action into your Stream Deck and select the summoner and spell you want to be displayed.\
Once the game starts the spells from the enemy team are loaded including the champion's icon.\
You can enable automatic chat messages that display the accurate time when the spell will be back up.

Single press: Starts the timer or sends a chat message if already started.\
Long press: Resets the timer.
